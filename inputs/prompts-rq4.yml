      Carry out demand-driven conceptual
      design of a multidimensional cube using the DFM, starting from the following requirements. The output
      I expect is a DFM schema in YAML formatted as follows: (1) the fact is a "fact" tag including a
      "name" tag; (2) all measures are listed inside a "measures" tag, each is an empty item containing a
      "name" tag; (3) all many-to-one associations between attributes in a hierarchy are listed inside a
      "dependencies" tag: each is an empty item containing a "from" tag, listing the finer attribute, and a
      "to" tag, listing the coarser attribute; (4) the "dependencies" list also includes an item from the
      fact to each dimension, and one from the fact to each measure. I want composite names to be treated as
      name example to NameExample.
