      Carry out supply-driven conceptual
      design of a multidimensional cube using the DFM (Dimensional Fact Model), starting from the following
      source relational schema. 
      The output I expect is a DFM schema in YAML formatted as follows: 
      (1) the fact is a “fact” tag including a “name” tag; 
      (2) all measures are listed inside a "measures" tag, each is an empty item containing a "name" tag; 
      (3) all functional dependencies between attributes in a hierarchy are listed inside a "dependencies" tag: 
      each is an empty item containing a "from" tag, listing the finer attribute(s), and a "to" tag, 
      listing the coarser attribute(s); 
      (4) the "dependencies" list also includes an item from the fact to each dimension, and one from 
      the fact to each measure; 
      (5) if a dependency is from and/or to a combination of attributes, they should be comma-separated.

      Please double-check that: (i) the dependency graph is connected; (ii) functional dependencies are 
      directed from the dependent attribute(s) (e.g., city) to the determinant attributes(s) (e.g., country);
      (iii) all FDs are returned (i.e., all attributes from the original schema are included).

      Return only the YAML without any further information/explanation.
