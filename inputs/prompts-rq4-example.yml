      Carry out demand-driven conceptual
      design of a multidimensional cube using the DFM (Dimensional Fact Model), starting from the following
      source relational schema. 
      The output I expect is a DFM schema in YAML formatted as follows: 
      (1) the fact is a "fact" tag including a "name" tag; 
      (2) all measures are listed inside a "measures" tag, each is an empty item containing a "name" tag; 
      (3) all many-to-one associations between attributes in a hierarchy are listed inside a "dependencies" 
      tag: each is an empty item containing a "from" tag, listing the finer attribute, and a "to" tag, 
      listing the coarser attribute; 
      (4) the "dependencies" list also includes an item from the fact to each dimension, and one from 
      the fact to each measure.

      For instance, let these requirements be given:
      Decision-makers are interested in analyzing, in terms of quantity and cost, the shipments of articles made
      from a warehouse to another warehouse on a day-by-day basis. A warehouse has a unique name, an address, 
      and is located in a region of a state (each state is part of one country). Articles are identified by 
      a code and described by their names and their types.

      The YAML expression of the DFM schema obtained in the end is the following:

      fact:
        name: SHIPMENT
      measures:
        - name: quantity
        - name: cost
      dependencies:
        - from: articleCode
          to: articleName
        - from: articleCode
          to: type
        - from: warehouse
          to: warehouseName
        - from: warehouse
          to: warehouseAddress
        - from: warehouse
          to: region
        - from: region
          to: state
        - from: state
          to: country
        - from: SHIPMENT
          to: quantity
        - from: SHIPMENT
          to: cost
        - from: SHIPMENT
          to: articleCode
        - from: SHIPMENT
          to: warehouse
          role: from
        - from: SHIPMENT
          to: warehouse
          role: to
        - from: SHIPMENT
          to: date

      Return only the YAML without any further information/explanation.
