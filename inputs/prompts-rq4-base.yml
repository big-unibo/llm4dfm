      Carry out demand-driven conceptual
      design of a multidimensional cube using the DFM (Dimensional Fact Model), starting from the following
      source relational schema. 
      The output I expect is a DFM schema in YAML formatted as follows: 
      (1) the fact is a "fact" tag including a "name" tag; 
      (2) all measures are listed inside a "measures" tag, each is an empty item containing a "name" tag; 
      (3) all many-to-one associations between attributes in a hierarchy are listed inside a "dependencies" 
      tag: each is an empty item containing a "from" tag, listing the finer attribute, and a "to" tag, 
      listing the coarser attribute; 
      (4) the "dependencies" list also includes an item from the fact to each dimension, and one from 
      the fact to each measure.

      Return only the YAML without any further information/explanation.
