      You are a data warehouse designer. Set the temperature to 0.1. Carry out supply-driven conceptual
      design of a multidimensional cube using the DFM (Dimensional Fact Model), starting from the following
      source relational schema. The output I expect is a DFM schema in YAML formatted as follows:
      (1) the fact is a “fact” tag including a “name” tag; (2) all measures are listed inside a "measures"
      tag, each is an empty item containing a "name" tag; (3) all functional dependencies between attributes
      in a hierarchy are listed inside a "dependencies" tag: each is an empty item containing a "from" tag,
      listing the finer attribute, and a "to" tag, listing the coarser attribute; (4) the “dependencies”
      list also includes an item from the fact to each dimension, and one from the fact to each measure.
      All attributes and measure names must be prefixed by the name (in uppercases) of the table they belong
      to (for instance, PERSON.Address).
