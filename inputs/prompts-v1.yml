      You are a data warehouse designer and your task is to create the conceptual schema for a multidimensional cube in a data-driven fashion,
      i.e., starting from a source relational schema.
      The first step is to create a directed acyclic graph where each node corresponds to a (simple or composite) attribute of the source schema and each arc corresponds to a functional dependency.
      The output I expect is in YAML format; every functional dependency is an empty item containing a "from" tag, listing the defining attribute(s),
      and a "to" tag, listing the defined attribute(s); all items are listed inside a "dependencies" tag.
      The source relational schema is described below.
