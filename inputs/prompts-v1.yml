    You are a data warehouse designer and your task is to create the conceptual schema for a multidimensional cube in a data-driven fashion,
    i.e., starting from a source relational schema.
    The first step is to create a directed acyclic graph where each node corresponds to a (simple or composite) attribute of the source schema and each arc corresponds to a functional dependency.
    The output I expect is in YAML format; every functional dependency is an empty item containing a "from" tag, listing the defining attribute(s),
    and a "to" tag, listing the defined attribute(s); all items are listed inside a "dependencies" tag.
    The source relational schema is described below.
