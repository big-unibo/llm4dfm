  Decision-makers are interested in analyzing the rentals made in a car rental company.
  Each rental is quantitatively described by an amount, a discount, an insurance cost (one for each risk),
  and a number of miles travelled. A rental is done for a car (identified by its plate), has a pickup
  and a dropoff date, and a pickup and a dropoff office. A car has a registration date, a fuel type,
  and belongs to a category; it has a model which is manufactured by a brand. Offices are located in cities;
  each city is in a state that belongs to a country. Countries are grouped into areas.
