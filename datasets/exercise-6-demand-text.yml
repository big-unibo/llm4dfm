  Decision-makers are interested in analyzing the transfers of staff from one department to another on a
  daily basis. Each transfer has a reason. Each staff member has an employee code, a name, a surname,
  a gender, a qualification; besides, he/she is described by their recruitment date and their current department.
  A department has a code and a name, and it belongs to one division. A division, in turn, has a code, a name, and
  a manager (who is a staff member).
