  Decision-makers are interested in analyzing the check-ins made by passengers for flights, in terms of the
  numer of bags boarded, the ticket amount, the tax amount, and the total amount. Passengers are described by
  their name, surname, birthdate, city of residence, document id, document type, telephone number, email address,
  and gender. A check-in is made by a passenger for a seat at a given time and corresponds to a ticket number.
  A ticket is purchased on a given date by a passenger (not necessarily the same who checked-in) and can be priority
  or not; it covers a flight (which may have a delay in departure and arrival, and may even be cancelled) made on a
  route on a given date. A route is characterized by the departure and arrival airports and time, and is operated by
  an airline using an airplane type with a given number of seats. Airlines are identified by a code and have a name 
  and a nation. Airports have a unique code and a name, and are located in a city belonging to a nation.
